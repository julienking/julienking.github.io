# The MoveIt! Website

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ros-planning/moveit.ros.org.svg?branch=gh-pages)](https://travis-ci.org/ros-planning/moveit.ros.org)

The moveit website (http://moveit.ros.org/) is hosted on **Github Pages** using Markdown format. The master branch is ``gh-pages`` as required by Github, and changes made to that branch become immediately available online.

## Test Locally on Ubuntu

Will install Ruby, Jekyll, build the website, and server the website on localhost:

    ./build_locally.sh
