# The MoveIt Website

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ros-planning/moveit.ros.org.svg?branch=gh-pages)](https://travis-ci.org/ros-planning/moveit.ros.org)

The MoveIt website (http://moveit.ros.org/) is hosted on **Github Pages** using Markdown format. The master branch is ``gh-pages`` as required by Github, and changes made to that branch become immediately available online.

## Images

Please compress images before loading to repo, we recommend [https://tinypng.com/](https://tinypng.com/). High resolution images from professional photographers will kill load times.

## Test Locally on Ubuntu 16.04

Will install Ruby, Jekyll, build the website, and server the website on localhost:

    ./build_locally.sh

TODO: the currently used version of Ruby is old and needs to be updated, but Ubuntu 16.04 is holding us back.
