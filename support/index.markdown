  * Check out the list of [Frequently Asked Questions](/documentation/faqs) to see if your question has been answered already.
  * Ask questions at [answers.ros.org](http://answers.ros.org/), the official question forum of ROS and MoveIt, if you haven't found similar questions.
  * Check the old [Google Groups list page](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/moveit-users) to find previous valuable discussions.
  * Post issues to the main [moveit](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues) code repository.

## Announcements and Discussions
