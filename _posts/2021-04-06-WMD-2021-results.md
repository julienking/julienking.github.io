We had the highest number of locations in the history of the MoveIt project (it helped that the world was more remote this year), and the 2nd highest number of pull requests we’ve ever had. Attendance was impressive and more diverse than ever, with a large showing coming from Tokyo, Berlin, and Istanbul. We’ll be reaching out to participants to learn more about what they enjoyed and what they’d like to see next year.
