We are happy to announce that Team Delft, a team of scientists and engineers from the TU Delft Robotics Institute and Delft Robotics, won the 2016 edition of the Amazon Picking Challenge which has just been held in Leipzig, Germany using MoveIt!. The challenge, which you can read about [here](http://amazonpickingchallenge.org/), aims to automate the "first and last miles of logistics". The task challenged robots to pick objects from containers and put them on shelves (the "stow task") and to pick objects from stocked shelves and put them into containers (the "pick task"). The variety of the objects and the unstructured environment still make this a considerably difficult task.

Several of the team members have written up a [short article](/assets/pdfs/2016/team_delft_apc_motion_module.pdf) describing how they used MoveIt! with their robot "to accomplish both the picking and stowing tasks in the challenge." The have also prepared the following video:
