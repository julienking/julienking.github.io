**Time and Venue**

* Date - Friday May 10, 2013
* Venue - ICRA 2013, Karlsruhe, Germany

**Organizers**

* Sachin Chitta, Willow Garage
* Ioan Sucan, Willow Garage
* Mark Moll, Rice University
* Lydia Kavraki, Rice University
* Maxim Likhachev, CMU

**Abstract**

This full-day tutorial is intended to expose both novice and expert users to the most recent developments, both theoretical and practical, on the topic of motion planning for mobile manipulation. The tutorial will combine talks on the latest algorithmic developments by leading experts with hands-on sessions where implemented tools will be presented and where participants will walk through actual applications in mobile manipulation. The tutorial will emphasize the practical aspects of using motion planners on real robots, by discussing the integration of motion planning techniques with perception, grasping and control. Particular attention will be paid to motion planning with constraints, with use cases highlighting the handling of constraints in real world tasks. Real-time performance will also be examined, including the application of motion planners in assisted tele-operation scenarios. The tutorial will be based on a wide range of tools, including those in the MoveIt! software framework, the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL), the search-based planning library (SBPL) and other associated tools.
