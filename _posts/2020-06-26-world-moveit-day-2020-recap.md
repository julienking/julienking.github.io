We are thrilled to report that World MoveIt Day was a great success this year. We would like to thank everyone who participated and supported. Unlike other years, this year's event was completely virtual, with everyone participating remotely. The Google Meet live stream of MoveIt developers, combined with discussions on the [Discord chat server](https://discord.gg/RrySut8) (not to be confused with Discourse) and GitHub all helped create a day of lively debate and development activity.

MoveIt continues to grow and improve and we appreciate everyone's contributions.

Now for the numbers:
- Number of registered participants: **80**
- Number of people who signed onto the [MoveIt Discord channel](https://discord.gg/RrySut8): **55**

Below are a few other statistics from the event and 30 days after, in the consolidated MoveIt repo. There are many other MoveIt related repos that we did not measure for this report:
- **67** pull requests merged
- **100** pull requests opened
- **24** issues closed
- **34** issues opened

These numbers are comparable with the numbers from the previous World MoveIt Day. [Refer to yearly Word MoveIt Day stats for details.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n19IOVJuqlQiFgLg5sRpWBPo5YQous25QmhUuJ2FO8g/edit?folder=0B2gNuURgfmGMa1dHYVkxWm9SQ2s#gid=0)
