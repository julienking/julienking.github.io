# Build MoveIt From Source

MoveIt is mainly supported on Linux, in particular:

* Ubuntu 17.10, 18.04 / [ROS Melodic](http://www.ros.org/wiki/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu)
* Ubuntu 15.10, 16.04 / [ROS Kinetic](http://www.ros.org/wiki/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu)

As of February 2019, [MoveIt for ROS 2.0](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2) development has begun but is not ready yet.

## Prerequisites

### Install ROS

Follow all the instructions to [install ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation). Please make sure you have followed all steps and have the latest versions of packages installed:

    rosdep update
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

Source installation requires [wstool](http://wiki.ros.org/wstool), [catkin_tools](https://catkin-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and optionally [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html):

    sudo apt-get install python-wstool python-catkin-tools clang-format-3.9

### Create Workspace and Source

Optionally create a new workspace, you can name it whatever:

    mkdir ~/ws_moveit
    cd ~/ws_moveit

Next, source your ROS workspace to load the necessary environment variables, depending on what version of ROS you installed.

Choose one of the three:

    source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
    source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash

This will load the ``${ROS_DISTRO}`` variable, needed for the next step.

## Download Source Code

By default, we will assume you are building the latest branch -  `master`.
This branch builds for ROS Kinetic and newer, e.g. on Ubuntu 16.04 and newer.
If you would like to build an older release of MoveIt from source, see the section below.

Pull down required repositories and build from within the root directory of your catkin workspace:

    wstool init src
    wstool merge -t src https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros-planning/moveit/master/moveit.rosinstall
    wstool update -t src
    rosdep install -y --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro ${ROS_DISTRO}
    catkin config --extend /opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO} --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

## Optional: Excluding Packages from a Build

MoveIt is a large project and the default compile time can easily take around 30 minutes.
If you would like to reduce your compile time or only need to build a subset of all the packages, `catkin` allows you to configure only a subset of packages to include in a build.
Be careful not to disable packages that are needed by others (ie: are a dependency of other packages).
You can exclude packages from a build in several ways:

 - ``catkin-tools --blacklist`` (recommended)
 - ``touch /path/to/package/directory/CATKIN_IGNORE``
 - ``rm -rf /path/to/package/directory``

Here we show some examples using ``catkin_tools``. Note: If you have already built these packages in your workspace you will need to use ``catkin clean`` first.

### Disable All High-Level User Interfaces (optional)

    catkin config --blacklist \
         moveit_commander \
         moveit_setup_assistant \
         moveit_ros_robot_interaction \
         moveit_ros_visualization \
         moveit_ros_benchmarks \
         moveit_controller_manager_example \
         moveit_ros_warehouse \
         moveit_ros_manipulation \
         moveit_visual_tools \
         rviz_visual_tools

### Disable CHOMP Motion Planner (optional)

Note, every command to ``catkin config --blacklist`` will override the previous list by default. Using the option ``--append-args`` you can augment the existing blacklist.

    catkin config --blacklist \
         moveit_chomp_optimizer_adapter \
         moveit_planners_chomp \
         chomp_motion_planner

## Optional: Install a Compiler Cache

Even if you decide to not build *all* of MoveIt, building it from source can still take quite some time.
Because of this, it can be beneficial to use a tool called a *compiler cache* to avoid recompiling files that have not been changed between builds but which with a regular build (without such a cache) would still be processed by the compiler.
This situation is especially common when switching between different branches while developing and when `clean`ing a Catkin workspace and then rebuilding it.

[ccache](https://ccache.dev) provides such a compiler cache and using it can reduce the time needed to rebuild MoveIt (and other packages) from many minutes to mere seconds.
Note: `ccache` is only compatible with GCC and only caches (Obj)C/(Obj)C++ output, but as MoveIt is largely a C++ application it can benefit greatly.

**Note**: as `ccache` uses the filesystem to cache objects, be sure to have sufficient free space available.
The default maximum cache size on Debian and Ubuntu is up to 5 GB for a full cache (if there are no files in the cache, it will not take up any space).
Configure a different maximum with the `--max-size` option.

Refer to the [ccache website](https://ccache.dev) for more information on when the cache is used and how to change its configuration.

### Installation (Debian/Ubuntu)

On a Debian or Ubuntu system, installing `ccache` is simple:

    sudo apt-get install ccache

### Installation (other systems)

On other OS, consult the package manager or software store and search for `ccache`.
Refer to the [ccache website](https://ccache.dev) for more information on downloading and installation.

### Setup

`ccache` provides a wrapper script that inserts itself between calls to GCC and the cache.
The script is compatible with GCC command line invocations, but it must be explicitly configured for use (just installing the `ccache` package is not enough).

To use caching with *all* invocations of GCC, it is sufficient to place the `/usr/lib/ccache` directory on the `PATH` (note: `usr/lib/ccache` is used on Debian and Ubuntu systems, adapt paths accordingly on other OS).
By making sure `ccache` is found *before* the regular GCC, all invocations of GCC will automatically go through the `ccache` wrapper script.

A convenient way to update the `PATH` for your user would be to append the following to the `.bashrc` file (or the equivalent user profile if not using `bash` as your shell):

    export PATH=/usr/lib/ccache:$PATH

The following command can be used to do this for `bash`:

    echo 'export PATH=/usr/lib/ccache:$PATH' >> $HOME/.bashrc

Then activate the new setting for the current `bash` session (if not using `bash`, substitute the appropriate command):

    source $HOME/.bashrc

New sessions will automatically update the `PATH`, so this is only necessary for your current session.

To use caching just *for specific projects*, set the `CC` and `CXX` environment variables before invoking `make`, `cmake`, `catkin_make` or `catkin build`.

**Note**: `ccache` can only cache compiler output if the compiler actually outputs something.
If a Catkin workspace has already been built, enabling `ccache` and rebuilding the workspace will not result in any caching, as most of the targets will not need rebuilding.
To seed the cache, clean out the *build* and *devel* spaces of the workspace (either remove them manually (ie: `rm -rf build devel`) or by using `catkin_tools` (`catkin clean -y`)) and start a new build.

Cache statistics can be output using `ccache -s`.

Refer to the [ccache website](https://ccache.dev) for more information on controlling when the cache is used and how to retrieve statistics.

## Build MoveIt

    catkin build

### Source the Catkin Workspace

Setup your environment - you can do this every time you work with this particular source install of the code, or you can add this to your ``.bashrc`` (recommended):

    source ~/ws_moveit/devel/setup.bash # or .zsh, depending on your shell

## Advanced

### Building Older Releases Of MoveIt

It's best to contribute to our latest branch, even if you're still on an earlier version of Ubuntu. However our latest branch does not support older versions of ROS such as ROS Indigo. Use the following command to build older releases from source:

    wstool init src
    wstool merge -t src https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros-planning/moveit/${ROS_DISTRO}-devel/moveit.rosinstall
    wstool update -t src
    rosdep install -y --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro ${ROS_DISTRO}
    catkin config --extend /opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO} --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    catkin build
